  A society, a social system, requires universal recognition of its fundamental
  properties in order to generate and sustain a necessary coherence. If everyone
  in a given society does not have an organic sense of belonging to the same
  society as everyone else then that society is a failure. That does not mean
  that everyone must be the same or totally equal in every way. It means that
  inequalities would not be so extreme.
