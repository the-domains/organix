A society, a social system, requires universal recognition of its fundamental properties in order to generate and sustain a necessary coherence. If everyone in a given society does not have an organic sense of belonging to the same society as everyone else then that society is a failure. That does not mean that everyone must be the same or totally equal in every way. It means that inequalities would not be so extreme. Income and wealth inequality, for instance, would look like a trapezoid rather than a triangle.

In order to achieve such an arrangement drastic revolutionary changes must be made in our social systems. Changes that promote social and economic justice wherein everyone will have the opportunity to engage in the pursuit of happiness as they perceive it. The opportunity to have the life that one envisions for oneself.

The concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few, as we all know, does not lend itself to social and economic justice. And as we saw in 2008 a few bankers in an irresponsible pursuit of there own unchecked self-interest brought the world to the brink of disaster.

The banker's self-interest was unchecked with respect to a collective-interest. Indeed, it seems that self-interest is the culprit in all such crises, past and present.

Now, self-interest is an attribute of capitalism and collective-interest is identified with socialism and we think of them as diametrically opposed to one another. Self-interest is considered by many to be a bad thing in and of itself. But it isn't. It's all a matter of how it's directed. For example, self-interest during our primitive existence is what accounted for the formation of close knit groups, collectives, where individuals put the solidarity of the tribe above themselves. It was self-interest in one's own survival that bound individuals together and formed a collective-tribal-interest. Surviving in the wild on one's own was not an option. Belonging to a tribe exponentially increased one's chances of survival. It was also in one's self-interest to contribute to the tribe's well-being, to see to it that it was as harmonious as possible. A tribe in optimum condition was much more likely to survive and that, again, benefited each and every individual's self-interest because their survival depended upon the collective condition of the tribe. So, individual self-interest creates collective-interest and they operate as a dynamic.

The very same self-interest/collective-interest dynamic is a fundamental aspect of modern societies as well.

Although in our minds self-interest and collective-interest are separate, opposite and in conflict with one another, as the former is associated with capitalism and the latter with socialism, they are in fact always intertwined. It is plain for everyone to see that it is in everyone's self-interest to be part of various collectives of one sort or another be it a family, school, club, business, gang, community, etc. Forming and being part of collectives is in the self-interest of everyone because that is how everyone's self-interest can best be realized. One participates, then, in the maintenance of collective organizations as a means of fulfilling one's self-interest while it is in the interest of the collective to allow individuals to pursue their own self-interest, which includes maintaining the collective-interest.

A business, for instance, is a collective made up of individuals all with a self-interest to contribute to the ongoing success of the business, to keep it profitable. Work then is performed to benefit the collective which in turn benefits everyone's self-interest in making money.

One's self-interest is never pursued in an absolutely free state. It is amended and given relevance by the collectives one finds it necessary to belong to. But sometimes the collectives that individuals belong to, like [Enron][0], [Countrywide][1], [Bear Sterns][2] and the like operate in an isolated insular way only interested in generating profit for themselves. These collective entities believed they were pursuing their self-interest with their shady money making schemes but as they eventually find out they were actually working against self-interest. They behaved like cancerous tumors seeking their own growth at the expense of the whole corporate well-being. The tumors metastasized, the cancer spread and they were severely compromised.

A full realization and understanding of the self-interest/collective-interest dynamic on the part of each and every individual would be a positive step toward weaving a sound socioeconomic fabric in which everyone could put their trust.

With this in mind we need to rethink and redesign the whole system where the government, the economy, the banking industry, the media and the citizenry form as seamless a social fabric as possible.

We need to define the terms, create the framework and lay out a blueprint for the radical changes necessary to govern effectively and do business in the 21st Century.

First and foremost we need to focus on the fundamentals and then focus on them some more and then keep focusing on them.

Fundamentals like money. We need to know and have a firm grasp of what money's purpose is in a social body. Generally speaking the purpose of money is to energize the work that needs to be done to create and maintain a healthy vigorous social body.

Money also plays into the self-interest/collective-interest dynamic.

Collective interest is created out of a universal self-interest - the interest to survive. Everyone has an interest in their own survival. In order to survive in a modern society one needs to acquire money, one way or another. This results in the creation of employers and employees, which form collectives -- businesses - wherein one's self-interest in making money can be realized as can the interests of the business.

There is also a self and collective interest to have a system for the purpose of handling money. That would, of course, be a banking system whose role would be, among other things, to facilitate the operation of the economic system.

The socioeconomic system now in place is top heavy, convoluted, disconnected and generally obsolete.

Take, for instance, the way money from the private sector is pooled for the benefit of the collective-interest. The pooling of money to serve the collective interest is, of course, in every one's self-interest. For example, if some disaster befalls a particular area we all want to know that funds will be available for assistance. The pooling of money is now the purview of governments that have the power to tax. So, part of the money that is made in the private sector by individuals and businesses and in the pubic sector by government workers is collected, in the US for instance, by the IRS and then the congress decides how to redistribute it.

The whole rigmarole of taxation and redistribution is a bureaucratic nightmare that is all too expensive. The power to tax lends itself to abuse and it can never seem to be wielded in a judicious manner.

So, although a society needs to pool its money for its collective-interest it need not be accomplished through government's power to tax.

Another way of pooling a society's money will be submitted here a little further on. There is, as we shall see, a way of doing this that would have everyone paying their fair share and have appropriate funds readily accessible whenever and wherever they were needed.

But first let's look at the circulation of money in the private sector. In the system now in place money starts its journey from the upper echelons of the federal apparatus and banking industry from where it finds its trickle down way to the rest of us. And when things are good this is supposed to be a boon to everyone. As Ronald Reagan claimed, "A rising tide raises all boats." But somehow it doesn't seem to work out that way. I guess not everyone can afford to own a boat. Like the tax system, the manner in which money is circulated lends itself to abuse, is not judicious and is inefficient.

In designing a socioeconomic system we can take a lesson from the composition of everything else in existence. Every macro system is composed of micro bits. Everything is built by connecting small discrete bits together to form a macrocosm. The microcosm fashions the macrocosm - from infinitesimal quantum particles to the gigantic universe - from hydrogen atoms to enormous galaxies - the whole biosphere is made possible by minuscule molecules of DNA -- life forms are made up of microscopic cells - buildings are built brick by brick, nail by nail, rivet by rivet. And this how a socioeconomic system should also be created and maintained. That is, built up from localities -- communities, neighborhoods, towns, villages. So, the idea is to, first and foremost, support and secure the foundation of a social system and then go on from there.

The circulation of money, then, would begin at the local level. Local banks, then, would begin the process of distributing the money supply throughout the whole system. The money would be supplied by the system's "reserve". Initially, the local banks would, of course, invest in their own communities in both the private and public sectors. Through sound banking practices local economies prosper and this adds to the banks' value and their ability to borrow more money from the reserve. The local banks would use "extra" reserves to fund a county bank to handle larger investments in the area.

County banks would actually be comprised of local banks and they would invest in the larger projects that would benefit the operation of the localities. County banks would be dependent on local banks for funding and, so, could not take on any projects without approval from localities.

The county banks would, similarly, create state banks, state banks regional banks and the regionals a national bank. Local banks would have to have confidence in all the various banking terminals from the county to the national. The confidence level would determine the amount of capital local banks would invest in county banks, state banks and the rest. Local banks would control the money supply throughout the system. Thus the financial system would not stray very far from its foundation.

The banking system would be a hybrid of public and private entities. Banks would be owned by the public. Not owned by government but owned by the people while they would be run by private individuals. Any profit to be made on behalf of the banks would come from honoring the peoples' banking charter to maintain a healthy vigorous economy.

The social dynamic of self-interest/collective-interest also demands other services that need to be fulfilled by a system of government.

Government, however, would not have the power to tax. The public sector would be allocated funds by private citizens and businesses, via the banking system. The scope of government would be determined by whatever is deemed necessary by those in the private sector. That is, government would provide only those services deemed necessary by the people.

The government per se would have nothing to do with the collection and allocation of money. Whatever government was deemed necessary to support and integrate the system would receive the appropriate funds with which to operate efficiently. Such funds would amount to a share of the wealth generated by the economy to be allocated to government as required with respect to particular circumstances.

A good image to illustrate this system would be to imagine the whole society afloat on a national collective pool of money. The total deposits of each and every bank would create this pool. That is, all the money in every individual account and every business account would contribute to the collective reservoir of funds. Everyone would contribute virtually all of their resources to the pool, which is as fair as possible, and everyone would benefit from the public works that would be funded from the pool. Again, the role of government would be determined by we the people. So, people would have a healthy tension between spending their money on necessary public sector functions while holding on to as much of their money as possible. A conflict of two self-interests in the need for essential government and conserving one's personal resources.

One way to do this would be for governments (local, state, regional and national) to submit their budgets to the banking system for consideration by the people. Individuals would be able to accept the proposed budget fully or partially. If partially one would modify the budget as desired and if there were enough similar moderations the budget would be appropriately updated. Businesses would not have any say whatsoever in drafting a budget. They would still be able to lobby government officials but there would not be any money involved in those efforts. When a budget is approved by the people the bank accounts of individuals and businesses would be charged a given percentage of their total deposits. That is, banks would compare the amount of the budgets with deposits on hand and arrive at what percentage of their deposits would be needed to meet budget requirements.

So, everyone, individuals and businesses, contributes equally. In this vision of things everything flattens out floating on the pool. No higher and lower, only different perspectives and roles.

Banks would be pivotal to this symbiosis. Government, business people and bankers would gather together to decide how available funds should be used in order to serve their mutual interests which must be kept in synch with the interests of the entire community as well. Bankers and businessmen would want to keep at a minimum the funds needed for government so it would not be a drain on the economy. On the other hand they would also have an interest in things being governed effectively in order to facilitate social and economic activity.

Every dollar spent for government would need to have real value to the whole community in making a vital contribution to society's proficiency as a synergistic unit. One way to keep government limited would be for the banking industry, business and individuals to play by the rules, to effectively police themselves . The private sector would not have to spend a lot of money in lobbying efforts or contribute large sums to political campaign funds in seeking advantageous legislation and tax breaks. This would add to their value and free up resources for investment, research and development. Also government would not have the ability to bailout any businesses that got into trouble but it would have the ability to penalize businesses that misbehaved with hefty fines. So, a culture of self-regulation would be seen as advantageous in the private sector.
