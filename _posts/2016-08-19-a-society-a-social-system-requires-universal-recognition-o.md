  A society, a social system, requires universal recognition of its fundamental
  properties in order to generate and sustain a necessary coherence. If everyone
  in a given society does not have an organic sense of belonging to the same
  society as everyone else then that society is a failure. That does not mean
  that everyone must be the same or totally equal in every way. It means that
  inequalities would not be so extreme. Income and wealth inequality, for
  instance, would look like a trapezoid rather than a triangle.
